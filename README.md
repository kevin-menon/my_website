# Reflexion about this site

Cannot be a general purpose sharing site. People will see no interest over FB, Twitter, unless it resolves some of the issues from it

--> main FB problem is that people waste a whole lot of time watching/reading useless things feeling guilty afterwards, and harming their mental health with anger, envy, shame and generally frustration. Maybe set a daily limit with content filtered or not given visibility.
    pb with filtered content is that it is hard to determine. Content should not be too short. Pb with nowadays content is it affects our attention, we cannot stay focused longer than a few minutes: example people can't watch movies without their phones.

A game where you learn and enjoy about how to behave. 

Let's meet and do things together!
